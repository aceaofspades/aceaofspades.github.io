<hr>
<h2 id="two-engineers-walk-into-a-bar">Two Engineers Walk Into a Bar</h2>
<p>For my Gordon Engineering Leadership class (ENG 211), we had to perform a &ldquo;stretch goal&rdquo; to exercise the leadership skills that we were building in the class. For this stretch goal, we had to participate in &ldquo;Two Engineers Walk Into a Bar.&rdquo; The setup for this assignment was simple: take two—or in my group&rsquo;s case, three—engineers, send them to a bar or other public place, and make them hold a sign that says, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Engineers! Ask us a question!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To complete this stretch assignment, my group went to UCSD&rsquo;s new on-campus <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/soda-and-swine-ucsd-la-jolla">Soda &amp; Swine restaurant</a> for their Thursday afternoon Happy Hour! Even though the food was a little pricey, it was nice to be able to talk with my group mates about graduate school and the learning environment at UCSD. Unfortunately, we weren&rsquo;t able to convince people to visit our table, but the assignment was still a whole lot of fun! Next time, I would try &ldquo;Two Engineers Walk Into a Bar&rdquo; somewhere off-campus to engage more with the public.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-summary-of-february">A Brief Summary of February</h2>
<p>February was quite a busy month for me and my graduate program as a whole. Here&rsquo;s the low down of the events that happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I applied and was selected to become an instructor for my program&rsquo;s Welcome Week Bootcamp for incoming students. The Welcome Week Bootcamp is a week-long course for incoming Bioinformatics &amp; Systems Biology graduate students meant to introduce you to the program faculty and the resources needed to succeed in your first-year research rotations.</li>
<li>My graduate program had its Recruitment Weekend, and it was jam-packed with activities meant to convince interview candidates to come to our school. There&rsquo;s welcome dinners, interviews, lunches, presentations, and lots of networking!</li>
<li>The Steering Committee for my graduate program had its quarterly meeting in February. The Steering Committee decides the strategic plan for my graduate program, and they&rsquo;re in charge of the curriculum, admissions, stipend, and more. They requested an update on student activities, so some other students and I compiled a report on graduate student accomplishments and solicited grievances that students wanted to bring up to the faculty.</li>
<li>I went on a field trip to <a href="https://www.epsilonsystems.com/">Epsilon Systems Solutions</a> with the Gordon Center as part of my engineering leadership class. During this field trip, I was able to gather valuable insight into the recruitment process and what employers look for out of a prospective engineering applicant.</li>
<li>Several friends from the Bay Area came to visit me in San Diego! We visited various breweries and restaurants during their stay—however, a brief volleyball game re-aggravated my sciatica. I was left debilitated for a week! While things are better now, I&rsquo;m still having some difficulty walking or exercising as much as I used to.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these events, combined with research and teaching, made it very difficult to prioritize what needed to get done versus what could sit on the back burner. It felt like my goals of completing my research project were slipping through my fingers.</p>
<h2 id="departmental-pressures-and-the-resulting-student-fatigue">Departmental Pressures and the Resulting Student Fatigue</h2>
<p>This past month, I felt a lot of pressure from the systematic structures of my graduate program. For the recruitment weekend, students and administration were the key players in organizing events, coordinating travel across the large UCSD campus, and managing several of the weekend&rsquo;s expenses! Whenever an interview candidate complimented the breadth of student involvement, I felt my shoulders feel more weighed down by the lack of faculty support.</p>
<p>Additionally, preparing for the Steering Committee meeting was especially stressful. For my graduate program, we host a Town Hall meeting once a year as a forum for students to provide input to the Program Chairs on the current student environment. At the last Town Hall meeting during Spring 2019, the current Program Chair at the time was only present for 30 minutes! To garner more program awareness of student issues, several students and I gathered current student input to present at the Steering Committee meeting through a survey.</p>
<p>While it was comforting to see that students generally shared the same sentiment towards the program faculty versus program administration, most students felt defeated as a whole. Most students were not confident in the department&rsquo;s ability to act on their promises to improve the coursework, raise the stipend, or even care about student life in Bioinformatics &amp; Systems Biology.</p>
<p>Reading these responses, combined with participating in the recruitment weekend, made me feel hopeless about the state of faculty disinterest in the structure of our program and student input. As a highly-involved student activist in a program that is seemingly resistant to change, this whole situation made February one of the worst months in the academic year to date. Sometimes, I wonder what would happen if I left these calls for policy changes to other students. When I think about that, combined with the fact that there are only about five other students that would put their research aside for student advocacy, I feel overwhelmed. As of late, I feel a little better, yet still pressured by this imposing need to convince faculty to show their support for their students.</p>
<p>A wise person once told me something with the gist of, &ldquo;While you may have the best intentions, it&rsquo;s the way your actions are perceived that leave the overall impact.&rdquo; Nowadays, I&rsquo;m thinking about this phrase <em>a lot</em> when it comes to departmental drama.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been finishing up a large, important portion of my research that I hope to share on this blog soon! In the meantime, look out for another update in the coming week or so. I&rsquo;ll be presenting a project that I had in the Farley Lab at the <a href="https://genetics.ucsd.edu/annual-retreat/index.html">13th Annual UCSD Genetics Training Program Retreat</a>. I just finished the poster earlier today and I&rsquo;m excited to share it!</p>
