      <p>So far, this quarter has been a whirlwind! I&rsquo;ve been focusing a lot more on my research project, but some of my other responsibilities just take up more time than I anticipated so I don&rsquo;t actually end up getting as much done as I would like.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="coursework-recap">Coursework Recap</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m very close to finishing the course requirements for <a href="https://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/">my graduate program</a>! This quarter, I decided to decrease my course load in order to focus a bit more on research and other duties. I&rsquo;ll be finishing up my course electives next Spring Quarter 2020!</p>
<p>This Winter Quarter 2020, I&rsquo;m taking the following classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>BIOM 242: Seminar in Genetics</strong>. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As part of the UCSD Genetics Training Program, I&rsquo;m required to participate in this weekly journal club in which students present and discuss papers on the principles of classical and molecular genetics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>BNFO 281. Seminar in Bioinformatics &amp; Systems Biology</strong>. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> My program, in partnership with the UCSD Genetics Training Program, has a <a href="http://genomic.weebly.com/">weekly seminar series</a> where invited faculty members from various universities give presentations on their research. While the talks are more genomics and genetics focused, they&rsquo;re generally quite good even though people in my program are required to attend for the first two years of graduate study.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>BNFO 283. Bioinformatics Student Research Talks</strong>. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For my program, we have a weekly seminar course where 1st- and 2nd-Year graduate students practice their presentation skills by giving a talk in front their peers and interested faculty members. This quarter, since I&rsquo;m a 2nd Year student, we&rsquo;re supposed to be presenting draft versions of our <a href="https://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/node/37">Qualifying Examination</a> talk!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ENG 211. Engineering Leadership in Academia</strong>. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This quarter, I didn&rsquo;t want to just focus entirely on research, so I tried looking for classes that weren&rsquo;t necessarily &ldquo;academic&rdquo;, but classes that could offer some practical skills for during and after graduate school. I was able to find a class taught by the <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/GordonCenter/">Gordon Engineering Leadership Center</a> at UCSD that focuses on teaching engineering leadership with fun and interactive exercises!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="organizational-structures-and-leadership-with-the-gordon-center">Organizational Structures and Leadership with the Gordon Center</h2>
<p>For me, the most exciting class this quarter is definitely ENG 211! So far, my favorite experience from the class was an interactive activity on <em>organizational structures</em> that we had two weeks ago. In this activity, our class (of around 20 students or so) was split into a total of five groups: one &ldquo;Top&rdquo; group, two &ldquo;Middle&rdquo; groups, and two &ldquo;Bottom&rdquo; groups upon entering the classroom. When the whole class had settled down into their groups, we found out the scenario of the activity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are all members of a bridge building engineering company. Everybody in the &ldquo;Bottom&rdquo; group is a part of the engineering team within the company. Everybody in the &ldquo;Middle&rdquo; group is a member of middle management within the company, which manages the &ldquo;Bottom&rdquo; people. Finally, everybody in the &ldquo;Top&rdquo; group is a member of the executive board within the company.</p>
<p>For this activity, a customer has come to the company and has commissioned designs for a bridge that can cross over a riverbank within the city. The goal of this activity is to produce designs for this client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this activity, I was a part of the &ldquo;Bottom&rdquo; group; there were ten of us total. For the &ldquo;Middle&rdquo; and &ldquo;Top&rdquo; groups, there were four and three people in each of those groups, respectively. While this activity seemed pretty simple at first, more details were given to us about the scenario:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To increase morale within the company, it was decided that this client&rsquo;s request be turned into an internal competition. There will be two &ldquo;Bottom&rdquo; groups, and each bottom group is to be managed by their own group of &ldquo;Middle&rdquo; managers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And with that, each &ldquo;Middle&rdquo; management team was given a piece of paper with the client specifications for the bridge, along with building supplies (e.g. wood barrel #2 pencils, paper clips, green card stock, and printer paper) that were each associated with their own cost. The goal of the activity was to build a small toll bridge that could be built efficiently according to the parameters provided, and that could sustain the weight of 20 cars (represented by metal bolts) while earning a profit over time.</p>
<p>However, information about what the client wanted weren&rsquo;t given directly to the &ldquo;Bottom&rdquo; teams! That information was given to our &ldquo;Middle&rdquo; managers from the client, and we had to rely on an elaborate game of telephone to communicate what materials we needed to build the bridge, what progress we&rsquo;ve made on the project to &ldquo;Top&rdquo; management, and other things! It was a fun, highly-interactive activity that showed the complexities of information flow within an organization, as well as the politics within corporations!</p>
<p>This week, I&rsquo;ll be completing one of the assignments for the class dubbed as a &ldquo;Stretch Goal&rdquo;. For this assignment, I&rsquo;ll be sitting down at a bar with two other students holding a sign that says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an Engineer! Ask Me Questions!&quot;. While I&rsquo;m nervous about putting myself out there, I&rsquo;m excited to see what questions people ask or if people even come up to us!</p>
<h2 id="teaching-practical-bioinformatics-101">Teaching Practical Bioinformatics 101</h2>
<p>In addition to taking classes, I&rsquo;m also helping Prof. Alon Goren teach a course in &ldquo;Quantitative Methods in Genetics and Genomics&rdquo; (listed as CMM 262) as one of three Graduate Teaching Assistants. Technically, I&rsquo;m supposed to be taking this course as a part of the Genetics Training Program requirements, but hopefully, <em>teaching it</em> counts towards the requirement!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the course description from our <a href="https://github.com/biom262/cmm262-2020">GitHub website</a> in case you&rsquo;re interested:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quantitative Methods in Genetics and Genomics is designed to teach experimental and analytical approaches in modern genetics and genomics, from experimental design through data analysis in each of several topic areas. Lecturers this year include Daniela Nachmanson, Scott Rifkin, Robert Morey, Olivier Harismendy, Alon Goren, Graham McVicker, Ondrej Libiger, Nicholas Schork, Hannah Carter, Pablo Tamayo, and William Kim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Helping TA the class has been a great refresher into the different bioinformatics tools that people use for RNA-sequencing analysis and other pipelines! The class itself is highly interactive, and each week focuses on a different genomics analysis toolkit to teach students about through hands-on programming exercises in <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a> and <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-10.html">R Markdown Notebooks</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>As we move into Week 4 of the academic quarter, I hope that I&rsquo;ll be able to make some decent progress on my research so that I can post about it here! I&rsquo;m also working on a new section of this website that&rsquo;ll feature tools that I use to stay organized, productive, and even not so productive.</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>
